# Single-Sign-On
Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials (such as username and password). Instead of requiring users to log in separately to each application, SSO enables them to authenticate once and gain access to all authorized resources seamlessly.
